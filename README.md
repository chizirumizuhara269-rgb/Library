# books lib — A Simple Library for Developers

Live site: **https://books.chizumizu.space/**

Just a clean, no-nonsense place to find and download the books and papers every developer should read at some point. No login, no popup, no tracking — just search, click, and download the PDF.

Think of it like a small personal library that got put on the internet so everyone can use it.

### What does it do?

Pretty simple:

1.  You open **[books.chizumizu.space](https://books.chizumizu.space/)**
2.  You see a list of books — each row has a name and a tag like `python`, `js`, `git`, `os` etc.
3.  You can filter by category using the little tab bar on top, or just type in the search box — it does fuzzy search, so even if you type `pytn` it’ll still find `python`.
4.  Click on any book name and the PDF downloads straight away.

That’s it. That’s the whole idea.

### How it actually works

Not much magic behind the scenes:

*   This is a super lightweight **Node.js + Express + EJS** app. No database.
*   All the book info lives in one file — `meta_dt.json`. Each entry is just a slug, title, and a tag.
*   The actual PDFs are sitting in the `uploads/` folder.
*   The homepage (`/`) reads `meta_dt.json`, collects all the tags, and renders the table from `views/index.ejs`.
*   When you click download, it hits `/download/:slug` — the server checks the slug safely (blocks `..` / `/` tricks), finds the matching PDF in `uploads/`, and sends it to you. Nothing fancy, just secure and simple.
*   All the filtering and fuzzy search happens right in the browser with vanilla JS — no extra libraries.

There’s also a static build for hosting. Running `pnpm run build` renders the EJS to plain HTML and copies everything to `dist/` (with `uploads` inside). That `dist` folder is what gets deployed to GitHub Pages / the custom domain. It also creates a `.nojekyll` and a `404.html` so the custom domain `books.chizumizu.space` works fine.

### Project Structure

```
library/
├── index.js                # Express server — routes for / and /download/:slug
├── meta_dt.json            # The whole "database" — list of books
├── uploads/                # All the PDF files
├── views/index.ejs         # The single page UI
├── public/                 # Static assets
├── scripts/build-static.mjs# Builds static site to dist/ for Pages
├── dist/                   # Generated static site (after build)
└── CNAME                   # books.chizumizu.space
```

---

### Run it locally

```bash
# install deps
pnpm install

# dev mode (auto-reload)
pnpm run dev

# or normal start
pnpm start
```
Then open `http://localhost:8080`

To build the static version for deployment:
```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run preview
```

### How to add a new book

1. Drop the PDF into `uploads/` — e.g. `my-new-book.pdf`
2. Add an entry in `meta_dt.json`:
```json
"b10": {
  "slug": "my-new-book",
  "title": "My New Book",
  "description": "this is development",
  "tag": "python"
}
```
Make sure the `slug` matches the PDF filename without `.pdf`. That’s all — it’ll show up on next reload/build.
